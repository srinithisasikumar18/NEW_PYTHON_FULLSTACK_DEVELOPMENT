React: popular on 2016. it is a library(gropu of files) for building user interfaces.
it is a component driven architecture (it automatically create its own object automatically).
for developing single page application.
why u need single page aplication:
without reloading i want  to refresh my page.
giving json response would not refresh the page.
----install react with using:
1)npm
npx 
>npx create-react-app react-31
>cd react-31

we can't render multiple tags.
component=a picece of UI logic.
